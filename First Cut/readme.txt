How to Play:

Attacking:

Pressing attack will perform a horizontal attack.

Holding up while you attack will perform a high vertical attack.

Holding down while you attack will perform a low vertical attack.

Holding the attack button will let you delay your attack.

Holding your attack will charge your movement speed when you release it.

You can cancel an attack before it begins by dodging.


Blocking:

Incoming attacks can be blocked by holding your sword at the correct height.

If you press attack immediately after blocking you will perform a counter attack.

When two attacks meet in the air they will be parried.


Dodging:

There are two kinds of dodge:

A normal dodge will duck under a horizontal attack, but you will be vulnerable to vertical attacks. You can block while ducking.

Pressing up while you dodge does a sidestep. You will avoid vertical attacks but will be vulnerable to horizontal attacks. You cannot block while sidestepping, but pressing down will change your dodge into a duck.

Holding the dodge button will let you stay down until you release it.

If you press attack while dodging you will counter attack after getting up.



Shoving:

Hold the shove button and press forward to push your opponent away. Press backwards to pull your opponent towards you.


Counters:

Blocking your opponent and pressing attack as quickly as possible will result in a counter slash that will be faster than normal.


Fatigue:

Blocking attacks, being shoved, and missing swings will build up fatigue which slow your attacks down slightly.

Fatigue recovers very quickly when you're not currently performing an action.

Fatigue can be avoided by dodging instead of blocking, aiming strikes carefully, and using footwork to stay out of range.








The first attack to connect will win the round.





This game is a prototype and is rough around the edges, especially the menu.
